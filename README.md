# Papermill Demo

To use this repository:

1. Fork it into your own account.
2. Open your repository in GitHub Codespaces.
3. Codespaces should install all Python dependencies automatically. If it does not, use `requirements.txt`.
4. If you want to run the final cell (saving a plot to S3) you must populate three `env` variables.
